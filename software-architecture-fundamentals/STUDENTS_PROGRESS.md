## 📈 Progress Timeline

### November 7, 2025 - Course Initialized

- Created comprehensive software architecture learning plan
- 42 lessons covering fundamentals to advanced topics
- 10 modules structured progressively
- Ready to begin learning journey

### November 7, 2025 - Lesson 01 Completed ✅

- **Topic**: What is Software Architecture?
- **Score**: 3/3 (100%) on knowledge check
- **Time**: ~1 hour session
- **Status**: Excellent understanding demonstrated

### November 7, 2025 - Lesson 02 Paused (Strategic Decision) 🔄

- **Topic**: Architectural Thinking & Trade-offs
- **Progress**: Covered Parts 1-5 (fundamentals, framework, patterns)
- **Student Decision**: Pause to learn underlying technologies first
- **Reason**: "I don't know these systems well enough to analyze trade-offs"
- **Plan**: Learn patterns, technologies, then return for deep trade-off analysis
- **Status**: Excellent self-awareness and learning strategy!

## 💡 Key Breakthroughs & Insights

### Architectural Thinking - Context is Everything

**Date**: November 7, 2025

Student demonstrated strong grasp of context-driven decision making:

- Recognized monolith vs microservices depends on team size and scale
- Used real-world examples: "small ecommerce shop" vs "social media platform"
- Understood evolution: "starting with monolith and moving to microservices"
- Analogy: "skyscraper serves different need than a house" - excellent architectural thinking!

### Database Selection - Requirements Drive Choices

**Date**: November 7, 2025

Strong reasoning for personal finance app:

- Chose SQL for transactions (ACID properties, consistency critical)
- Considered scale for categories (< 100 vs > 100 items)
- Avoided over-engineering while being thoughtful
- "Stable, no risk of duplicate entries" - identified key requirement!

### Trade-offs Understanding - Electron Example

**Date**: November 7, 2025

Identified VS Code's biggest architectural trade-off:

- Electron = cross-platform benefits vs high compute/memory cost
- Understood Microsoft accepted this because "memory is cheap, developer time is expensive"
- Context awareness: This works for modern dev machines, not for low-resource environments

## 🎯 Strengths & Areas for Growth

### Strengths

- **Contextual thinking**: Naturally considers team size, scale, and requirements
- **Trade-off analysis**: Understands every decision has pros and cons
- **Practical examples**: Relates concepts to real-world scenarios
- **Quick learner**: Grasped core concepts immediately
- **Critical thinking**: Questions and analyzes rather than accepting at face value

### Areas for Growth

- **Technical depth**: Will develop deeper understanding of specific patterns and technologies as we progress
- **Documentation practices**: Will learn formal architecture documentation (ADRs, diagrams)
- **Large-scale systems**: Will explore more complex distributed system challenges
